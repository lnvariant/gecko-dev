# Diagnosis

Several function definitions of OnSizeAvailable either include redundant null-checks, or none at all for the arguments. In particular, some definitions of the function do not have a null check for the "aImage" parameter (in ImageLoader). A different defintion has a redundant null-check for "aRequest" since it is retrieved by dereferencing "aImage", which is already null-checked.

## Solution

Find all function definitions of "OnSizeAvailable" and remove the redundant null-checks of "aRequest" and add the neccessery null-checks of "aImage".

## Testing

One can run the mozilla firefox build and debug the the OnSizeAvailable function. They can observe that if "aImage" paramter passes the null-check, then "aRequest" automatically is non-null and thus we can continue execution of the function.
